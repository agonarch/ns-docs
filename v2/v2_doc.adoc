=== 1.0 Authenticating
For version two, the API employs token based authentication. An issued token has a 24-hour validity period.

==== 1.1 Requesting for a token
To request for a token, make a GET request to <<main.adoc#_environments,environment_base_url>>/login using basic authentication with valid user credentials.
As response a JWT token is returned and is valid for 24 hours.

Having received the token, subsequent calls to the API have to be made with token placed in the `Authorization` header of the request with prefix `Bearer`.

When the token is expired you will receive a response Token expired and youâ€™ll have to make sure to request for a new token. Or, just make sure to request for a token every 24 hours. Do NOT request for a token before every other API call you do; this is causing a lot of unneccesary API traffic on both our as your servers.

Example header key `Authorization` with value `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInppcCI6IkdaSVAifQ...`

You can also request for a key by specifying the parameter response=key. This key can be used in the direct links. This key is 24 hours valid.

To get the account where the user belongs to, specify the parameter response=account.

To get the token, the key and the account, specify the parameter response=token,key,account.

NOTE: In case of a failed request, an appropriate response with be given, indicating a likely cause.
